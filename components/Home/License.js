                    <p>The CC BY-SA license is used by Wikipedia and similar resources, which means you can include material from Wikipedia in your decks as long as you include the original source. It also ensures that material created by SlideWiki users is always attributed to the orginal author, which we believe enhances the quality and probity of educational resources. </p>
